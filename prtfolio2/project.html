                    <h3>AI Image generator Website</h3>
                    <p>I developed an AI Image Generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to generate images based on custom text prompts. The platform has a clean, responsive design with a user-friendly interface where users can input descriptions, processed by an AI model integrated via API. HTML and CSS provide the structural and stylistic foundation, while JavaScript handles API communication and dynamic interface updates. This project highlights my expertise in web development, focusing on enhancing user experience and seamlessly integrating AI functionality with modern web technologies. The website also includes error handling to guide users through input requirements, ensuring smooth interaction. Additionally, a loading animation keeps users engaged while the AI processes their requests, making for an intuitive, interactive experience from start to finish.

                    <h3>Online Exam Portal</h3>
                    <p>I built an Online Exam Portal using Django, designed to streamline exam management with distinct roles for Admin, Teacher, and Student. The Admin has comprehensive control, overseeing teacher and student management. Teachers can create question papers, assign students, and track their performance, while students can participate in exams and view results in real-time. This platform features a user-friendly interface, secure access, and efficient navigation, making it an ideal solution for organizing online exams and demonstrating my skills in back-end and role-based web applications. Additionally, the system includes automated grading and result calculations, minimizing manual effort and enhancing accuracy. This project highlights my proficiency in developing scalable solutions that prioritize security and accessibility for educational environments.
